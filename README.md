- Go to settings > Actions > General
- In the section 'Workflow permissions', click in the option 'Read and write permissions'
- In the root directiory of your repository, create a folder named `.github`
- Inside that folder, create another one named `workflows`
- Create an archive named `openai-code-review.yml`, and add the following content:

```yml
name: OpenAI code review

on:
  push:
    branches: ["*"]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "*" ]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions: write-all

env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.openai_api_key }}
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }}
  PULL_REQUEST_INFO: ${{ github.repository }}


jobs:
  openai-code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: OpenAI code review
    steps:
      - name: Golang setup
        uses: actions/setup-go@v3
        with:
          go-version: 1.19.5
